# Assurity Task #

Assurity Test Case

Thank you for this opportunity and allowing me to try out.

I did 2 different coding examples for your attention:
1. PowerShell
2. Python

### 1. Powershell ### 

[*Source File*](AssurityPowershell.ps1)

I use PowerShell a lot and wanted to show how it could be used in this scenario.
To run the test, you could simply download the ps1 file, then on any Windows machine run this command from the 
Windows key => Run console:

`powershell.exe -file "localtion of downloaded ps1 file"`

for e.g.

`powershell.exe -file c:\TEMP\AssurityPowershell.ps1`

### 2. Python ###

[*Source File*](AssurityPython.py)

For the Python example, **it requires the 'requests' module** to be installed. (`pip install requests`).
I used this module to handle the web request.
